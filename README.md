# HandWritten-Digit-recognition

Project Overview:
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision. The MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9), is used as the standard benchmark for this task. In this project, we build a CNN to classify the digits with high accuracy.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Normalization and reshaping of the MNIST dataset.

Training: The model is trained for 5 epochs with an 80-20 training-validation split.

Evaluation: The model is evaluated on the test dataset to determine its accuracy.

Saving the Model: The trained model is saved for future use.

Dependencies:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
